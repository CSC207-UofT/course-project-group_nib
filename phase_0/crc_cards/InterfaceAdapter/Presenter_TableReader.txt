        - Store user account info.
        - Read and check if user info are valid. (i.e. if new username is unique; if password matches the username)

    - Collaborators
        - Entity.Entity.User. TableReader helps store Entity.Entity.User info.
        - UserInfoTable. TableReader helps to store info into UserInfoTable.
        - WelcomePartController, where users can register or log in.
            - If the user is registering, the info will be stored in TableReader
            - If the user is logging in, TableReader will read and check if the username and password matches.
        - package Data. Both of UserInfo and TableReader should be in the same package, as they store the user Data.
