Controller: MainPageController

    - Responsibility
        - Allow users to interact with notes, such as to create new note, modify an existing note, comment on a note,
        or rate a note.

    - Collaborators
        - WelcomePartController, since users can only access to MainPageController after successfully register and login
        in the WelcomePartController.
        - UserInfo, since users can only register or login after pass the checking process in UserInfo.
        - Main.ProjectMain, which collaborates with WelcomePartController to proceed to MainPageController.
