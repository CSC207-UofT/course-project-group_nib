## Group project for Project_NiB!

This project is an online resource-sharing system. It is designed to create an open-source environment for students to share their notes and understandings about courses and subjects to help each other. It allows users to register accounts, log in to their accounts, share their posts about their notes taken during classes, access the notes and posts shared by other users.
