## Group project for ProjectMain!

This project is an online resource-sharing system. It is designed to create an open-source environment for students to share their notes and understandings about courses and subjects in order to help each other.

It allows users to register accounts, log in to their accounts, share their own posts about their notes taken during classes, access the notes and posts shared by other users, and interact with them by Q\&A sessions. 

The notes should be rateable (other users can rate the notes), commentable (other users can comment on the notes), and possibly referable (other users can create notes based on this note) if the original author allows that.

Supplementary information are documented in the following google docs:

Task 2 Write a Specification

Users can either create a new note, modify an existing note, comment on other notes, or rate notes. There are various Categories as courses in the system where users can upload their notes corresponding to each course.  Each note is classified by courses. The note is labeled with the date updated, and indicates whether it can be edited by the user. If a note is the original form from the user who uploads it, a tag called “Original” will be labeled as well. If the note is not original, it should have references listing the referenced articles. 

Each user can login to their account by username and password. If the user doesn’t have the password yet, he should register and set a new one. The user can leave comments and rate the notes. If a user uploaded a note, its name will be shown as the author of the note, and indicate the type of the note, such as pdf, jpeg, typing or handwritten. 

When notes are uploaded, users who browse the notes can leave comments and ratings for the author of the notes. Users can gain stars on their profile when they are rated with high credibility. The notes with authors that have higher credibility can be shown prioritized compared to other notes in a course. Once each note is uploaded, it will be uploaded to a database that collects and compiles the notes. The notes can be sorted by date, name of course, originality, author(user)’s credibility.
