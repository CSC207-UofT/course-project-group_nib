## Group project for Niubi!

This project is an online resource-sharing system. It is designed to create an open-source environment for students to share their notes and understandings about courses and subjects in order to help each other.

It allows users to register accounts, log in to their accounts, share their own posts about their notes taken during classes, access the notes and posts shared by other users, and interact with them by Q\&A sessions. 

The notes should be rateable (other users can rate the notes), commentable (other users can comment on the notes), and possibly referable (other users can create notes based on this note) if the original author allows that.

Supplementary information are documented in the following google docs:
